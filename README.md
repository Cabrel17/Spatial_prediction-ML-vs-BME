# Master's Thesis â€“ Spatial Prediction (BME vs ML)

This repository contains all the code, data, and results used for my Master's thesis:  
**"Assessment of Machine Learning and Bayesian Maximum Entropy Methods for Spatial Prediction across Different Spatial Dependency Levels and Asymmetry"**

## Repository Structure

- `data/` : Input datasets  
  - `real/` : Real-world measurements (PM10)  
  - `simulated/` : Simulated spatial datasets (45 scenarios)

- `scripts/` : Main scripts for modeling and analysis  

- `src/` : Utility functions and helpers

- `results/` : Prediction results

- `requirements.txt` : Python package dependencies

## Environment

Tools:
- Python 3.11
- MATLAB R2014+ (for BME modeling)
- R 4.3+
